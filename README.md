# Tic Tac Toe

We want to bring the pen-and-paper game Tic-tac-toe to the digital age, but with a little twist: the size of the playfield should be configurable between 3x3 and 10x10. And we also want the symbols (usually O and X) to be configurable. Also it should be for 3 players instead of just 2.
